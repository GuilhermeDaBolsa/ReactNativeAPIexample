# ReactNativeAPIexample (School Project)

ReactNativeAPIexample is a React Native App that consumes some {JSON}Placeholder APIS.

Here you can get all users posts and see its details clicking on it.
You can also delete a post clicking in the 'delete' button, but as {JSON}Placeholder documentation says it is a fake delete.
